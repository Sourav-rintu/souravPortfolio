Welcome to my personal portfolio! I'm excited to share with you how I created this space to showcase my education, skills, projects. My portfolio can support any device like phone, laptop, tablet etc.  

Development Process

I started by sketching out ideas and wireframes to visualize the layout and structure of the portfolio. This helped me plan the user experience and ensure a cohesive design throughout the site.

2. Technologies Used
Frontend: I built the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Bootstrap was used for responsive design and styling, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

Hosting: The portfolio is hosted on GITHUB, ensuring reliability and accessibility.

3. Development
With the design and technologies in place, I started coding the portfolio, focusing on clean code, scalability, and performance. Each section of the portfolio, from the homepage to the project pages, was carefully crafted to highlight my skills and experiences effectively.

4.Deployment
Once development and testing were complete, I deployed the portfolio to GITHUB, making it accessible to visitors worldwide. Regular updates and maintenance ensure that the portfolio remains up-to-date and reflective of my latest work and achievements.

Conclusion
Creating this portfolio was a rewarding journey that allowed me to showcase my abilities and accomplishments while honing my development skills. I'm excited to continue evolving this space and sharing my passion with others.
